## Purpose

Have you ever landed in the promise hell? Especially mixing synchronous and asynchronous functions?

In this case, this module might be of some help for you.

## There are two versions

- ![Version 3](https://github.com/jcschmidig/mixed-pipeline/blob/master/readmev3.md) (the default version for backward compatibility) uses a few verbs to steer the flow.

- ![Version 4](https://github.com/jcschmidig/mixed-pipeline/blob/master/readmev4.md) has more options and uses a pure array to steer the flow more flexibly.
